## Practicals R Intro


This is the very first draft of a 3h practicals aiming to introduce R to Bachelor students of the course in "Genetica Molecolare ed ingegneria genetica".

The slides, created with ioslides and Rmarkdown, are based on the first chapter of this  excellent [document](https://evolutionarygenetics.github.io/Introduction.html). You are encouraged to go further exploring the next chapters.


## Warning ## 
This is really a short introduction and yu should not expect you will master R sufficiently well after this course.

Nevertheless, I hope that it will be useful to understand the importance of the use of R statistical language for reproducible and efficient data analysis on Biology.
